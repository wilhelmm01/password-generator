### Password Generator
 ## Changes
 Was tasked with creating a password generator by updating existing code. Solved by updating the following:
 * Added a function for "generatePassword" as it was referenced in the existing code without a function being created. 
 * Added an alert that determins the length
 * Created a loop to continuously recreate upon submitting button

## What's Missing from Requirements
* Not able to limit password length to 128 characters
* Unable to select desired characters (Uppercase, Lowercase, and Special Characters)

## What Works
* There is a window prompt to determin the length from the user and it works!


## My Struggles
* I spent a lot of time with the loop statement until I discovered the "charAT" as an indexing call. However, mixing research with the lesson 3.4.4, only about 50% understanding how it works
* I started to define global variables for the length and characters to they could be manipulated by the user (picking which type) but unable to get that to work. like the passlength one.
